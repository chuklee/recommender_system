I see. You're right to be curious about this, as it's not immediately obvious from the input format. Let me explain how the model uses movie features even though your input only contains movie IDs:

1. Movie Features Lookup:
In the `encode_input_features` function, there's a crucial part:

```python
movie_feature_vectors = movies[movie_features].to_numpy()
movie_features_lookup = layers.Embedding(
    input_dim=movie_feature_vectors.shape[0],
    output_dim=movie_feature_vectors.shape[1],
    embeddings_initializer=keras.initializers.Constant(movie_feature_vectors),
    trainable=False,
    name="features_vector",
)
```

This creates a lookup table for movie features. It's using the `movies` dataframe, which presumably contains additional features for each movie (like genres). The `movie_features` variable likely contains the names of these feature columns.

2. Using the Lookup:
When encoding a movie, the function does this:

```python
def encode_movie(movie_id):
    movie_idx = movie_index_lookup(movie_id)
    movie_embedding = movie_embedding_encoder(movie_idx)
    encoded_movie = movie_embedding
    if include_movie_features:
        movie_genres_vector = movie_features_lookup(movie_idx)
        encoded_movie = movie_embedding_processor(
            layers.concatenate([movie_embedding, movie_genres_vector])
        )
    return encoded_movie
```

Here's what's happening:
- The movie ID is converted to an index.
- This index is used to lookup both the movie embedding and the movie features.
- The features are concatenated with the embedding and processed.

3. Behind the Scenes:
The model is using the movie IDs you provide to lookup pre-loaded feature vectors. These vectors were created from the `movies` dataframe when the model was set up. So even though your input only contains movie IDs, the model has access to a table that maps these IDs to their corresponding feature vectors.

4. In Your Input:
When you provide `movie_661,movie_2918,movie_531,movie_3114`, the model:
- Converts these to indices
- Uses these indices to lookup both learned embeddings and pre-loaded feature vectors
- Combines this information for each movie

5. Important Note:
This setup assumes that the `movies` dataframe used to create the feature lookup table contains the same movie IDs as those in your input data, and that it has additional features for each movie.

In essence, you're providing a "key" (the movie ID) that the model uses to access a rich set of features that were prepared beforehand. This allows your input to remain simple while the model works with complex feature representations internally.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation?
